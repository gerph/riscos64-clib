# Changes

The changelog tries to follow <https://keepachangelog.com/>, with the following definitions used for the sections:

- **Security**: Changes which affect security (whatever type of change they might be).
- **Added**: New features, or implemented functionality.
- **Changed**: Existing features, or interfaces, which have been updated. Unless it's a large functionality change, stubs being implemented or made configurable fall into this group.
- **Fixed**: Bugs in the implementation which have been addressed. This does not include the addition of missing functionality unless that functionality was meant to be present.
- **Removed**: Features or implementations which have been removed and are no longer present.

Internal and design changes are not documented here, unless they impact the behaviour of the system.
